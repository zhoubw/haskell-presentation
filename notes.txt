Haskell Presentation
Everything will be done on ghci

- Functional programming language
- basically tell the computer what things are
- no double declarations
 - referential transparency: reliable functions - "pure"
 - no side effects
- basically transforming static data
- * static types
- type inference


- basics
 - math
  - let a = 2
  - succ xf
  
 - booleans


- lists
  - adding lists ++
  - faster adding to front: :
  - * strings
  - adding strings
  - search index: !!
  - reverse, maximum, minimum
  - Texas ranges!! [1..20] [1, 3 .. 21]
   - DON'T USE FLOATS
  - list comprehensions
   - [x * 5 | x <- [1..20]]

- functions
 - addMe x = x + 1

- types
 - :t : identify type
 - function: map type to type
  - addThree :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
  - addThree (x y z) = x + y + z

- pattern matching
 - kinda like switches!
 - areYouX :: (Integral a) => a -> String
 - areYouX 1 = "Are you 1?"
 - areYouX 2 = "Are you 2?"
 - areYouX x = "nope"

 - recursion
  - factorial :: (Integral a) => a -> a
  - factorial 0 = 1
  - factorial x = x * factorial(x-1)

- currying
 - Haskell functions only accept one argument
 - max 1 2 is (max 1) 2

- "data"
 - basically define your own type
 - data Int = -2147483648 | -2147483647 | ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 2147483647
